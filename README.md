# Spotify API Project

### A repository containing code, data and insights from a preliminary web scraping project using the Spotify API

Hi! Welcome. Currently the only thing in this repository is a jupyter notebook called [spotify_scraping.ipynb](spotify_scraping.ipynb). You will see that there are multiple calls to the API, and if you want to try it out you will have to use your own Spotify API keys you can receive [here](https://developer.spotify.com/). Have fun investigating!

See my blog post about this project [here](https://neil826t.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/09/22/SpotifyAPI.html).
